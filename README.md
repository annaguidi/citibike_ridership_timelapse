# citibike_ridership_timelapse
A look at how citibike ridership evolved post-coronavirus in march of 2020

## Context and aim of Project:

Somewhere between the second and third week of March 2020, the spread of covid-19 in New York City became increasingly apparent, causing, among other effects, people to stay home and work remotely, and subway ridership to decrease by up to 92% (https://brooklyneagle.com/articles/2020/04/08/new-york-city-subway-ridership-down-92-percent-due-to-coronavirus/) in an effort to social distance.

The goal of this project is to analyze the March Citibike dataset, to see if and where there has been a decrease (or perhaps increase) in ridership, and find an effective way to visualize these changes within the month.
